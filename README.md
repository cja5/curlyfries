Our group for Web Programming should use this to update the programming as we progress with the coursework.
Time to do stuff.



Game Ideas:
1. Team-based, colours represent the different teams
2. Melee combat w/ swords
3. When 'killed', player respawns after x amount of seconds elsewhere on the map
4. Multiple game modes ? (capture the flag, king of the hill, falling tiles etc...)
5. Power-ups such as temporary shields (mitigates damage for x amount of seconds) and health packs
6. Health bar 
7. Text chat ?
8. User-inputted name tag above character
9. Prevent cheating by introducing bounds in player stats that are regularly monitored (stopping players from manually editing their health bar)
10. Can try mouse movement too
